# Neighborhood
### Neighborhood is the app for discovering people all around you, know what they say about them and chat with them without the needing of an internet connection. 
With Neighborhood you can easily make your profile, share it with your
neighborhood and see other people's. Using Neighborhood is easy, just 
create your profile and then turn on your WiFi connection and discover
your peers to begin immediately to communicate with them. 
Neighborhood uses the Android WiFiP2P technology in order to
communicate with peers without the needing of an internet connection. 
The use of WiFiP2P introduces a number of improvements if compared with
Bluetooth. The improvements concern mostly the radio range, so you can
find peers at a distance 2 or 3 times wider than Blutooth lets you do,
and the network bit rate. WiFi is way faster than Bluetooth, and this 
feature will become more important in future versions, when file 
transferring will be implemented in Neighborhood.

In order to download this app you just have to type:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mattiadg/neighborhood.git
```
and open the project with AndroidStudio.
